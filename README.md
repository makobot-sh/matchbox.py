# matchbox.py
A simple python implementation of the Matchbox algorithm as defined in [1]. 
Create a Matchbox instance, configure the hyperparameters as desired then add ratings using the `addRating(userId, movieId, rating` method.
*Smoothing* (propagation of information backwards and forwards through event history) can be triggered by calling the `convergeModel()` class method.
The `printEvidence`, `printConfigs` and `printLatent` methods are provided to observe the state of the recommender.

## Experiments
The code to reproduce the experiment results presented in my thesis work **for our implementation of the Matchbox algorithm** can be found in the follwing branches:
- `matchbox_propio_binario` code to reproduce 100k rating runs with both synthetic and MovieLens datasets.
- `optimizacion` code to reproduce experiment where message 7 is replaced by the gaussian that minimizes reverse KL divergence with exact posterior.
- `pruebas_umbrales` code to reproduce table where threshold model is shown to "leak" evidence when there's more than one threshold.
- `recs-con-sin-convergencia` code to reproduce results shown in *Smoothing* example from section *2.1.3 Propagaci√≥n en el tiempo*.

## Results for other implementations and other algorithms
Code to reproduce experiment results for other Matchbox implementations and other algorithms is provided in separate repositories:
- Results for Infer.NET Matchbox implementation (`RecommenderSystem` class) and for the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms cam be found at https://github.com/glandfried/matchbox.net/tree/main . Details on the experiments performed on that code can be found in its README file.
- Results for 100k observation run on Infer.NET recommender system tutorial Matchbox implementation can be found at https://github.com/makobot-sh/matchbox-evidence/tree/our_experiments (branch `our_experiments`)
